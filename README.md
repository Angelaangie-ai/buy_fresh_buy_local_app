# Buy Fresh Buy Local App

After the pandemic, the area of Northampton County got hit by a strong economic crisis. 	As the residentsâ€™ income reduced, so did the consumption of healthy food.

The aim of our app is to help citizens learn about the different places where they can access sustainable food in the cities of Easton, Bethlehem & Allentown, according to their preferences & budget. 

Additionally, through the app, we support residents to shop from local shops, instead of supermarkets. In that case, they support local businesses, and help create a thriving sustainable economy
